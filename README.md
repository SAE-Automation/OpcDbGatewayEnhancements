# OpcDbGatewayEnhancements

OpcDbGateway enhancements, configurations and process databases

## What is OpcDbGateway

OpcDbGateway enables integration of software applications to collect, process and visualize data from different devices and data sources.

It is *application software development environment* consisting of IDE (GUI) for creating and debugging applications and a runtime engine/application without IDE. GUI is a configuring application (Configurator) that enbles configure connections to different data sources as databases, OPC server/client applications, DDE servers using different wizards providing high effectivity. It also enables to configure application logic using configurable commands. The base functionality of the product can be *enhanced by custom programmed modules*. This repository contains examples of custom programmed modules configurations and process databases.
